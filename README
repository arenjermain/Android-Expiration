What does it do?:
This Android mobile application will scan grocery products that have UPCs and set an alarm in your phone to notify you 
before your food expires! The application will help keep you from forgetting about food in your fridge. Instead of going 
out for dinner because you forgot about that delicious chicken you have in the back of the fridge, you can save time and
 money by eating in. MoldHold will save you extra trips to the grocery store to replace items hidden away in the fridge 
that you forgot about!

How to use it: 
Initially, you will scan a grocery item and enter its name and the expiration date listed on the packaging into a database.
Upon future scanning of that item, you will not be prompted to enter anymore information about the product as the phone 
will automatically access the expiration date from the database. The application will create a calendar using the your 
Google calendar account, specifically for the expiring for items. The application will calculate a date in the calendar 
based on the shelf life of the food item and set an alarm on that date. You will have the ability to decide how far in 
advance you want to be notified before your food expires.

Build Instructions:
Download application to your phone and allow access to Google Calendar.
