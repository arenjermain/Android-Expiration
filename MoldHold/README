What does it do?:
This Android mobile application will scan grocery products that have UPCs and 
set an alarm in your phone to notify you before your food expires! The 
application will help keep you from forgetting about food in your fridge. 
Instead of going out for dinner because you forgot about that delicious chicken 
you have in the back of the fridge, you can save time and money by eating in. 
MoldHold will save you extra trips to the grocery store to replace items hidden 
away in the fridge that you forgot about!

How to use it: 
Initially, you will scan a grocery item and enter its name and the expiration 
date listed on the packaging into a database. Upon future scanning of that item, 
you will not be prompted to enter anymore information about the product as the 
phone will automatically access the expiration date from the database. The 
application will create a calendar using the your Google calendar account, 
specifically for the expiring for items. The application will calculate a date 
in the calendar based on the shelf life of the food item and set an alarm on 
that date. You will have the ability to decide how far in advance you want to 
be notified before your food expires.

Android Specifications:
	-This project is built to be compatible with Android Platform 2.3.3. 
	-It requires that your phone has a built-in camera and internet access.
	-It requires that you have a Google account and allow access to your Google
